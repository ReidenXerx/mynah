// Claude Code PostToolUse → nudge the agent to refresh its TASK-CORE once enough UNSAVED work has
// accumulated.
//
// WHY NOT CONTEXT PERCENTAGE. This hook used to fire at ~90% of the context window, and the window
// is not knowable at runtime. The transcript does not record it, the model id does not settle it
// (`claude-opus-5` is the same string on a 200k session and a 1M one), and the one real
// measurement — `compactMetadata.preTokens` — only arrives AFTER a compaction has already happened.
// Two shipped attempts at inferring it were wrong in opposite directions: a hardcoded 200k made
// every 1M session read as 300% full and cry compaction from the first hour, and the correction for
// that could not reach the band it was written for. A gate on a number we cannot measure produces
// confident false alarms, which is worse than no gate (NS-5).
//
// WHAT REPLACES IT. The task-core exists so a long task survives compaction with its decisions
// intact. What makes losing it expensive is not how full the window is — it is HOW MUCH HAS
// HAPPENED THAT IS NOT WRITTEN DOWN. Five edits at 95% lose almost nothing; two hundred at 30% lose
// a great deal. Fullness was always a proxy for unsaved work, and a proxy we could not even
// measure. So count the work directly: edits since the task-core was last written.
//
// The reset signal is the core file's own mtime, so there is no second counter to fall out of sync
// with it — write the core and the count restarts by construction.
//
// LIMITATION, stated rather than hidden: a long research phase produces conclusions worth saving
// and makes no edits, so it will not trigger this. That case is the cheaper one — the code is still
// there to re-read — and the contract still asks for a core at a milestone regardless.
