// Claude Code PostToolUse → at the moment implementation STARTS, pose the consult test.
//
// Consult shipped as contract text and nothing else. The minion hook already names why that fails:
// "the fan-out trigger lives in the always-on contract, which means it fires when the agent happens
// to recall it." Consult had the same problem and no equivalent fix — northstars, taskcore and
// minions all got a runtime trigger; consult and microscope did not. Reported from use: the agent
// does not remember consult during its usual routines. It cannot; nothing reminds it.
//
// WHICH MOMENT. Consult's rule is "ask when you are about to INVENT a requirement rather than
// implement one", and no tool call means "I am inventing". The closest honest proxy is the
// transition from investigating to implementing — the FIRST edit of a session. That is when
// unstated requirements get decided, usually silently, and after it the decision is already in the
// code and costs a rewrite to revisit.
//
// This is a PROXY and is stated as one. It fires on every session with an edit, including ones
// where the task was fully specified and there is nothing to ask. That is why it nudges once and
// never blocks (NS-5): the cost of a wasted line is a line, and the cost of a silently invented
// requirement is the feature.
